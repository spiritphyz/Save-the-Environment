**Hack Nerd Font** is a patched programming font that includes both [Powerline separator glyphs](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code/issues/10#issue-481430946) and Devicons glyphs. They're designed to make terminal applications look "fancier" with sophisticated symbols â€” often seen in the status bars of Tmux, Neovim, and NERDTree.

Font Weights:
- Bold
- Bold Italic
- Italic
- Regular


### Installation

For macOS, unzip the archive, then double-click the TrueType font files to add them to Font Book. You can [see the complete instructions](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/Hack#quick-installation) for all platforms at the official repository.

A local version of Hack Nerd Font is stored here because the latest releases seem to have missing Devicons in Neovim and NERDTree. The older version of Hack stored in this repo has a working set of symbols that displays correctly in Neovim on Linux and macOS.
