# Colors
colors:
  # Allowed values are CellForeground and CellBackground, which reference the
  # affected cell, or hexadecimal colors like #ff00ff.

  # Default for cursor is 'CellForeground', but Alacritty doesn't draw the
  # background of the last character correctly when 'vi copy mode' is active
  # (it looks like the last character isn't selected because the highlight
  # only shows up to the second-to-last character).
  #
  # I'm avoiding this bugged CellForeground behavior during 'vi copy mode'
  # by setting the cursor to light blue to signify the end of the visual
  # selection when 'vi copy mode' is active.

  # Issue #4311 doesn't work for me either, usine OneDark theme
