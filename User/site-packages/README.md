# Fix padding to match GitHub
[Grip](https://github.com/joeyespo/grip) is a command line server that renders Markdown files to look like the Github-flavored rendition.

The official package seems to be slightly abandoned and needs some tweaks for padding ([#291](https://github.com/joeyespo/grip/pull/297/commits/af98f0e88dff0f3c5b1182467a904ef4e1a3cdbc)).

The [index.html](./grip/templates/index.html) template file in this repo will remove some incorrect margin and padding.

## Grip template locations
Replace the original `index.html` files below with the patched [index.html](./grip/templates/index.html) file in this repo.
```bash
# Linux
/home/username/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/grip/templates/index.html

# macOS
/usr/local/Cellar/grip/4.5.2_3/libexec/lib/python3.9/site-packages/grip/templates/index.html
```
