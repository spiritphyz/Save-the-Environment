# Save the Environment üåè
Let's save our settings for a better future.

## Sublime Text
* use [Oceanic Next](https://github.com/voronianski/oceanic-next-color-scheme) for React / JSX syntax highlighting
* use Vintageous for Vim keybindings
* highlight current line and emphasize matching braces
* use 2 spaces instead of tabs
* add snippets for console.log, for loops, and es6-style for loops
* bind `ctrl-option-]` to auto-indent multiple lines
* bind `shift-command-n` to open new view into file

## Bash Shell
Be sure to replace or append the .bash_profile file to an existing `/Users/yourusername/.bash_profile`. You can also run `source User/.bash_profile` to activate customizations.
* use colored output for directories and files
* add Unicode octopus to prompt to distinguish local shells

## Vim and Tmux
Customizations for a better JavaScript environment in the terminal
* auto-complete, linting, and syntax highlighting for React, JSX, and Angular web development
