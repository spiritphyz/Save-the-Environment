## Hack

**Hack Nerd Font** is a patched programming font that includes both [Powerline separator glyphs](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code/issues/10#issue-481430946) and Devicon glyphs as additions to the [well-designed base font](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/). The extra glyphs are designed to make terminal applications look "fancier" with sophisticated symbols â€” often seen in the status bars of Tmux, Neovim, and NERDTree.

## Iosevka

**Iosevka Nerd Font** has also been patched to include Powerline and Devicon glyphs. Iosevka has a [condensed look](https://typeof.net/Iosevka/) to fit more characters horizontally, which is useful for long lines inside Vim split panes and Tmux windows. Iosevka supports 160 languages and includes Vietnamese diacritics.

### Programming Ligatures
Both **Hack** and **Iosevka** include long ligature support to display single glyphs for common programming symbols like `=>`, `!==`, `<=` and `>=`.

# Installation

For macOS, unzip the archive, then double-click the TrueType font file to add that specific weight to Font Book.

For Linux and Windows, [Hack](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/Hack#quick-installation) and [Iosevka](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/Iosevka#installation) instructions are available at their official repositories.

A local version of Hack Nerd Font is stored here because the latest releases seem to have missing Devicons in Neovim and NERDTree. The older version of Hack stored in this repo has a working set of symbols that displays correctly in Neovim on Linux and macOS.
